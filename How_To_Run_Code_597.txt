Preparing the server

    sudo apt install -y gcc libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev libluajit-5.1-dev libpcap-dev openssl libssl-dev libnghttp2-dev libdumbnet-dev bison flex libdnet

Installing from the source

    mkdir ~/snort_src && cd ~/snort_src

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/daq-2.0.6.tar.gz
tar -xvzf daq-2.0.6.tar.gz
cd daq-2.0.6
Run the configuration script using its default values, then compile the program with make and finally install DAQ.

./configure && make && sudo make install
With the DAQ installed you can get started with Snort, change back to the download folder.

cd ~/snort_src

Download the source code with wget

wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.15.1.tar.gz

tar -xvzf snort-2.9.15.1.tar.gz
cd snort-2.9.12

./configure --enable-sourcefire && make && sudo make install

Configuring Snort to run in NIDS mode

Start with updating the shared libraries using the command underneath.

sudo ldconfig
Snort on Ubuntu gets installed to /usr/local/bin/snort directory, it is good practice to create a symbolic link to /usr/sbin/snort.

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/snort /usr/sbin/snort

Setting up username and folder structure
To run Snort on Ubuntu safely without root access, you should create a new unprivileged user and a new user group for the daemon to run under.

sudo groupadd snort
sudo useradd snort -r -s /sbin/nologin -c SNORT_IDS -g snort
Then create the folder structure to house the Snort configuration, just copy over the commands below.

sudo mkdir -p /etc/snort/rules
sudo mkdir /var/log/snort
sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules

Set the permissions for the new directories accordingly.

sudo chmod -R 5775 /etc/snort
sudo chmod -R 5775 /var/log/snort
sudo chmod -R 5775 /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
sudo chown -R snort:snort /etc/snort
sudo chown -R snort:snort /var/log/snort
sudo chown -R snort:snort /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules

Create new files for the white and blacklists as well as the local rules.

sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/white_list.rules
sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/black_list.rules
sudo touch /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
Then copy the configuration files from the download folder.

sudo cp ~/snort_src/snort-2.9.12/etc/*.conf* /etc/snort
sudo cp ~/snort_src/snort-2.9.12/etc/*.map /etc/snort

Using Community rules

wget https://www.snort.org/rules/community -O ~/community.tar.gz
Extract the rules and copy them to your configuration folder.

sudo tar -xvf ~/community.tar.gz -C ~/
sudo cp ~/community-rules/* /etc/snort/rules

Configuring the network and rule sets

sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
Find these sections shown below in the configuration file and change the parameters to reflect the examples here.

# Setup the network addresses you are protecting
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
# Set up the external network addresses. Leave as "any" in most situations
ipvar EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET

# Path to your rules files (this can be a relative path)
var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules
var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules
var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules
# Set the absolute path appropriately
var WHITE_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules
var BLACK_LIST_PATH /etc/snort/rules

In the same snort.conf file, scroll down to the section 6 and set the output for unified2 to log under filename of snort.log like below.

# unified2
# Recommended for most installs
output unified2: filename snort.log, limit 128
Lastly, scroll down towards the bottom of the file to find the list of included rule sets. You will need to uncomment the local.rules to allow Snort to load any custom rules.

include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
If you are using the community rules, add the line underneath to your ruleset as well, for example just below your local.rules line.

include $RULE_PATH/community.rules

Validating settings

sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Install Sar
sudo apt-get install sysstat

Install iperf
sudo apt-get install iperf3

In cmd prompt

Start Iperf server:
iperf3 -s

In another cmd prompt
ping 192.168.1.33 -t


Putty1
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf

Putty2
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.29 -t 240

Putty3
Sar -r 1 120 
Sar -u 1  120
